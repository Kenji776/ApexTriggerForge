# üî® Apex Trigger Forge

**Apex Trigger Forge** is a modular, metadata-driven trigger framework for Salesforce. It allows you to cleanly manage complex business logic, eliminate monolithic trigger files, and control execution dynamically ‚Äî all without sacrificing bulk safety or performance.

# üîß Feature Overview

---

## ‚úÖ Enable and Disable Triggers on Demand

**Description**:  
Each trigger logic handler is registered via a `Trigger_Logic_Control__mdt` metadata record. You can toggle logic execution on or off without deploying code.

**Example**:  
Temporarily disable automation during a data migration by unchecking the `Is_Enabled__c` field in metadata.

---

## üîÅ Recursive Logic Blocking

**Description**:  
Automatically prevents infinite loops where triggers recursively fire themselves, using execution context tracking.

**Example**:  
A trigger on `Invoice__c` updates `Fleet__c`, which tries to update the original `Invoice__c`. The loop is stopped by the framework.

---

## üìú Persistent Logging with Platform Events

**Description**:  
Logs are written using platform events, bypassing DML restrictions in trigger contexts like `before insert`.

**Example**:  
Log debug info even when DML isn‚Äôt allowed ‚Äî e.g., in `before update` ‚Äî using event-based logging.

---

## üîê Logging Control via Custom Settings

**Description**:  
Enable or disable logging at org-wide or per-user level using `Trigger_Settings__c` hierarchy settings.

**Example**:  
An admin disables logging globally, but enables it for their user to debug an issue.

---

## üö® Overrideable Enable/Disable Flag

**Description**:  
Force trigger logic to run even if it‚Äôs disabled in metadata ‚Äî useful for patches, tests, or emergency execution.

**Example**:  
Use `TriggerLogicController.forceEnable(logicName)` to run logic during testing even if metadata disables it.

---

## üßµ Toggleable Async Execution

**Description**:  
Run logic asynchronously via metadata ‚Äî no need for manual `@future` or `Queueable` wrappers.

**Example**:  
Run `Lead__c` enrichment logic in async mode by setting `Use_Async__c = true` in metadata.

---

## üîÅ Trigger Re-run Utility

**Description**:  
Rerun any trigger logic for any set of records via code or UI tool.

**Example**:  
Reprocess historical records using `TriggerLogicDispatcher.runLogic('LogicName', recordList)` after fixing logic.

---

## üì¶ Batch Execution of Trigger Logic

**Description**:  
Invoke trigger logic within batch jobs for mass updates or data fixes.

**Example**:  
Backfill logic across 100,000 `Bank_Transaction__c` records using the framework's batch runner.

---

## üì• Automatic Required Field Injection

**Description**:  
Specify required fields in metadata and the framework will ensure they are present by injecting missing data.

**Example**:  
Need `Fleet__r.Pay_Off_Amount__c`? Just include it in `Required_Input_Fields__c` and the framework handles the rest.

---

## üßæ Record-Level Log Viewer (LWC)

**Description**:  
A Lightning Web Component shows all logic execution logs tied to a record, with syntax highlighting and download capability.

**Example**:  
View the ‚ÄúTrigger Logs‚Äù tab on a record to see exactly what logic ran and when.

---

## ‚ùå Non-blocking Apex Errors

**Description**:  
Errors in logic blocks are caught and logged without halting the transaction. You can configure critical logic to fail hard.

**Example**:  
An NPE in one logic block logs its error while letting the rest of the process continue unaffected.

---

## üì¶ Installation

You can deploy using your preferred method (Salesforce DX, Change Sets, etc.). The package includes:

- Apex classes (framework core, batch jobs, logging)
- Custom Metadata: `Trigger_Logic_Control__mdt`
- Custom Setting: `Trigger_Settings__c`
- Platform Event (optional): `Trigger_Log__e`
- Lightning Web Component (optional UI for batch reprocessing)

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Create a Trigger Handler Class**
   ```apex
    public class AccountTriggerHandler_Sample implements TriggerHandler {
        //Set this is the name of the sObjects this handler is for.
        public static final string OBJECT_TYPE = 'Account';
    
        public static boolean CAN_USE_ASYNC = TriggerLogicController.canInvokeFutureMethod();
        
        /**
         * Executes logic before inserting Account records.
         *
         * @param newList List of SObject records from Trigger.new
         * @return list of inserted accounts
         */
        public list<Account> handleBeforeInsert(List<SObject> newList) {
            List<Account> records = (List<Account>)newList;
            return records;
        }
    
        /**
         * Executes logic before updating Account records.
         *
         * @param newList List of SObject records from Trigger.new
         * @param oldMap Map of SObject records from Trigger.oldMap
         * @return list of updated accounts
         */
        public list<Account> handleBeforeUpdate(List<SObject> newList, Map<Id, SObject> oldMap) {
            List<Account> records = (List<Account>)newList;
            return records;
        }
            /**
         * Executes logic after updating Account records.
         *
         * @param newList List of updated records (Trigger.new)
         * @param oldMap Map of old records (Trigger.oldMap)
         * @return list of updated accounts
         */
        public list<Account> handleAfterUpdate(List<SObject> newList, Map<Id, SObject> oldMap) {
            List<Account> records = (List<Account>)newList;
    
            List<Id> accountIds = TriggerLogicController.extractIds(newList);
    
            if (TriggerLogicController.isLogicEnabled(OBJECT_TYPE, 'after_update', 'getContactCountsByAccount')) {
    
                //you don't have to use async/future methods if you don't have a need for this. This framework was designed working around
                //large data loads so using async was commonly done but certainly not required if you don't need it.
                if(CAN_USE_ASYNC) AccountTriggerHelper_Sample.getContactCountsByAccount_Async(accountIds);
                else  AccountTriggerHelper_Sample.getContactCountsByAccount(accountIds);
            }
    
            // more methods here, controlled by the TriggerLogicController.isLogicEnabled method.
            return records;
        }
   }
   ```

2. **Register the Logic via Metadata**
   Create a `Trigger_Logic_Control__mdt` record with:
   - `SObject_Type__c = 'Account'`
   - `Trigger_Context__c = 'before_update'`
   - `Logic_Name__c = 'yourLogicBlock'`
   - `Trigger_Handler_Class_Name__c = 'AccountTriggerHandler'`

3. **Trigger Remains Clean**
   Your trigger just delegates:
   ```apex
    trigger AccountTrigger_Sample on Account  (
        before insert,
        before update,
        before delete,
        after insert,
        after update,
        after delete,
        after undelete
    ) {
        AccountTriggerHandler_Sample handler = new AccountTriggerHandler_Sample();
  
      // Determine trigger context string
      String context = TriggerLogicController.getTriggerContext(
          Trigger.isBefore,
          Trigger.isAfter,
          Trigger.isInsert,
          Trigger.isUpdate,
          Trigger.isDelete,
          Trigger.isUndelete
      );
  
      // Dispatch if context is valid
      if (!String.isBlank(context)) {
          try{
              TriggerLogicController.dispatch(
                  handler,
                  context,
                  Trigger.isDelete ? Trigger.old : Trigger.new,
                  Trigger.oldMap
              );
          }catch(exception e){
              TriggerLogicController.log('FATAL ERROR in AccountTriggerHandler_Sample Trigger\n'+ 
                                          context+'\n'+ 
                                          e.getStackTraceString()+'\n'+
                                          e.getMessage()+'\n'+
                                          String.valueOf(e.getLineNumber()), TriggerLogicController.LogLevel.ERROR);
          }
          TriggerLogicController.flushLogs();
      }
    }
   ```

## üß™ Reprocessing Records

Included LWC utility lets you:
- Select logic blocks
- Preview records
- Run batch jobs
- View live execution logs

Ideal for retrying failed logic or post-migration processing.

---

## üß¨ Design Philosophy

> _‚ÄúYour triggers should be smart, not cluttered. Forge the logic once‚Äîlet the metadata decide when it runs.‚Äù_

This framework is built with **modularity**, **traceability**, and **respect for platform limits** in mind. It‚Äôs meant for teams that want precision control over logic execution in growing orgs.
